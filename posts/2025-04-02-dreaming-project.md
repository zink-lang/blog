It's always been a dream building a programming langauge as a system engineer, since programming
langauge is part of the mediums for us communicating with machines and others, also, a baseline
tool for expressing our thoughts, creating our artworks, and so on.

Things could be done better with the current tech, at least, people can write their smart contracts
in a **single langauge** with **well-arched package manager** and **debugging system**.

It's possible and we are working on it.
